# translationSpace
A web based tool to aid in translating Japanese to English.

This is sa tool for translators moving from Japanese to English. If you're like me 
then you don't know every Kanji you should so when it comes time to translate a document
you need to go back and forth between your text and a dictionary. With this tool, paste
your Japanese text in the box on the left. As you skim the text for words you don't know,
highlight them with your mouse and they'll be looked up using Jisho.org's API. 

This is very much a work in progress and right now it doesn't work at all so please come
back again someday!
